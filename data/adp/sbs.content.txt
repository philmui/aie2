Here's some additional detail to help you decide which is right for you.  **Company (Summary):** The payroll total amounts in the file will be listed by account number for each payroll. With this option, employee and employer payroll taxes are listed in one lump sum, making it easier to reconcile against your bank statement.  **Employee (Details):** The payroll total amounts in the file will be broken out for each employee, by account number for each payroll.

What is an ADP Clearing account?    What is an ADP Clearing account?  The ADP Clearing account is a zero-balance account that's used to clear your employees' paychecks.  How do I use the ADP Clearing account?  If you have payroll expenses like cash payrolls or employee checks that are drawn individually on your bank account, the ADP Clearing account is used in your GL file to import each employee's net check number and net check amount, and the total direct deposit amount, as separate transactions into your checking account register.  After you import your GL file, the ADP Clearing account will show the total net pay amount zeroed out by each of the paychecks and direct deposits.  What happens if I don't have one?  Without the ADP Clearing account, you'd see your employee checks as one lump sum in your checking account register in your accounting software, making it difficult to reconcile with your bank statement.  You shouldn't use the ADP Clearing account in your day-to-day GL activities. It should be used only for the RUN Powered by ADP® GL import.  If you aren't sure if you need an ADP Clearing account, speak with your accountant or financial advisor.

Using a Bank Feed with Your General Ledger    Using a Bank Feed with Your General Ledger  What is a bank feed?  A bank feed is an online banking feature that lets you automatically download your bank transactions directly into your accounting software. It's like a digital bank statement that lets you match existing transactions in your accounting software, or add new transactions so you don't have to enter them manually.  How does a bank feed relate to my general ledger?  Like bank feeds, RUN's general ledger imports payroll transactions into your accounting software. That means less manual data entry for you, and easier account reconciliation.  RUN's general ledger file includes more detailed payroll data than a typical bank feed, though. A bank feed can be associated with only one GL account, but the general ledger file can be broken out into multiple GL accounts.  Can I use both?  Yes. But, i **t's important that you import the RUN GL file in your accounting software before you import your bank feed.** If you don't, you could end up with duplicate entries in your accounting software.  When you do import your bank feed, you can then match the items already added from your GL file. In general, you DON'T want to add bank feed transactions from ADP because there should already be a GL entry to match it. However, you DO want to add ADP Fees and ADP Pay-by-Pay transactions.  What if the GL entry to match with my bank feed is missing or vice versa?  Payroll processing fees and Workers Compensation (Pay-by-Pay) Insurance are not included in the RUN GL file. You'll need to add these amounts into your accounting software from your bank feed or by entering them manually.  If there was a payroll adjustment in RUN, there may not be a corresponding entry in the GL file. If this happens, contact our General Ledger Support Services team for help.  A bank feed may not exist yet despite having a general ledger entry. It could be that the check was not cashed yet or the wire transfer may have been delayed. A general ledger entry may have been created to signify an internal adjustment, which does not necessarily mean that there was any corresponding bank activity.  What if a GL amount doesn't match what's in my bank feed?  Payroll adjustments like these can cause discrepancies between your GL file and your bank feed:    * Tax recalculations   * Voiding or canceling checks, direct deposits, or payrolls including taxes   * Reissuing pay  If this happens, contact our General Ledger Support Services team for help.  
What are the rules for account numbers and names?    What are the rules for account numbers and names?

It should be listed separately in the account number field.  You can change account names, but **you can't change account numbers**. If you need to change an account number, you need to delete the account and add it again with the correct number.  An **account number** can have up to 50 characters.  An **account name** can have up to 95 characters.  If you are adding new accounts to your chart of accounts, it's a good idea to **keep them as short as possible** so you can always see the whole thing.  There's **no limit to the number of accounts** you can have in your chart of accounts.

When you set up your chart of accounts in RUN, use the Employee Mapping option to customize the account mappings for any or all of those employees.  For example, if you have accounts for a company officer, you can use Employee Mapping to map the officer's payroll items to those accounts.  **Important** : If you have employees who are paid in multiple departments, you should not set them up with employee mapping. Employee mappings will override any department mappings that are set up.

Learn more and make sure you get it right!    Learn more and make sure you get it right!  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires that most employees in the United States be paid at least the federal minimum wage for all hours worked and overtime pay at not less than time and one-half the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 hours in a workweek. These employees are called "non- exempt."  RUN sets up an employee as non-exempt for you in either of these cases:    * The employee is hourly.   * The employee is salaried, but earns less than the federal or state salary threshold.  Some employees are considered exempt from the minimum wage and/or overtime requirements of the FLSA. To be exempt, an employee must meet all three of these requirements.**    * They must be paid on a salary basis;   * They must earn at least the minimum applicable salary amount (see below); and   * They must meet certain tests regarding their job duties.  If your employee does not meet any of these requirements, you must classify them as non-exempt. For more information on whether a particular employee should be classified as exempt or non-exempt, see this fact sheet on the U.S. Department of Labor website.  **Federal and State Salary Thresholds (As of 1/1/2024)**  **Federal threshold:**    * $684 per week   **State thresholds**    * Alaska: $938.40 per week   * California: $1,280 per week   * Colorado: $1,057.69 per week   * Maine: $816.35 per week   * New York: $1,124.20 per week*   * Washington: $1,302.40 per week*  *There are different thresholds based on employee count and location.  **What else should I know?**    * **These are the federal requirements. States may have additional requirements for exemption.   * Make sure your employees are classified as exempt or non-exempt correctly to avoid penalties.   * All non-exempt employees are required to track their start work and end work time so that you can provide the overtime and meal rest benefits required by applicable law.

SUI notices    SUI notices  What is a SUI notice?  A SUI notice is a letter from the state, letting you know that your state unemployment insurance (SUI) tax rate has changed.  What to do when you get a notice  When you receive a SUI notice, it's important that you **upload a copy of it in RUN (just type tax notice in the search box and select Tax notices and amendments)** so we can file and pay your unemployment tax correctly with the state.  If you have SUI notices for more than one state, please upload them one at time. An individual SUI notice is usually one page, two if it includes a cover page.  As soon as your rate is updated in RUN (usually within 48 hours), you'll see a notification on your Home page. We'll also send you an email confirming the change. If we have to credit or debit your account because of the rate change, you'll receive a separate invoice with the details.  Remember to keep a copy of the notice for your records.  What is SUI?  State Unemployment Insurance (SUI) is a quarterly employer tax that's pay to a state unemployment agency. The money goes into a fund that's used to pay unemployment insurance benefits to employees who are let go from a job.  What is a SUI rate?  Your SUI tax rate (sometimes called an experience rate) is assigned by the state based on your unemployment history.  Your rate will go up and down depending on how many claims you make. If your unemployment claims are few and far between, your SUI rate will go down. If your unemployment claims increase, your SUI rate will go up.  States typically publish new SUI tax rates between November and January and mail SUI tax rate notices to employers.  How is my SUI tax calculated?  We use your SUI rate, along with your taxable wages (up to the state's taxable wage limit), to calculate the amount of tax you owe each quarter. Each state has its own taxable wage limit.  Use this chart to check each state's unemployment information including taxable wage limits, SUI rates, and any additional rates.  It sounds complicated, but we'll figure it out for you.  Helpful reports  The **Quarterly Tax Verification report** lists the SUI rate for any unemployment states that are set up for your company.

Look for the Make Up Tip amount at the top of the page.   **Tip** : You can also find the make-up tip amount on the employee's paystub, under Other Benefits and Information.  ![](arrowright.gif)See an example of a make up tip RUN calculates for you!  The standard Federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour The Federal Tipped Employee minimum wage is $2.13 with a Maximum Tip credit of $5.12. Restaurant X pays their eligible tipped employees  2.13 per hour, but if the employee's tips combined with their pay rate doesn't equal the applicable minimum wage, they must make up the difference. Remember, the minimum wage and tip credit rules can be different based on state and local rules, as well as other factors such as employee threshold, industry, etc.  So, if Restaurant X pays their employee $2.13 per hour and the employee is working 40 hours per week and making cash tips of $100, the payroll application calculates*:    1. The rate of pay x hours worked + cash tips to get total amount of **combined pay** ($2.13 per hour x 40 hours = $82.50 + $100 cash tips = $185.20).   2. The required minimum wage rate x hours worked to get the total amount of **required pay** ($7.25 per hour x 40 hours = $290).   3. The total amount of combined pay subtracted from the total amount of required pay to find the **amount owed to the employee** ($290 - $185.20 = $104.80 owed to the employee). The amount owed to the employee is the **make up tip amount** reflected in your employee's pay stub.  For up-to-date minimum wage information for your state, see the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) website.  **January 1, 2023 minimum wage increases:**  **Timing** : The US Department of Labor chart in the link above covers January 1, 2023 minimum wage increases for all applicable states and some larger U.S. cities. Some states increase their minimum wage rates mid-year or on a different cycle. The information below applies to January 1, 2023 increases only (Note: New York increases their minimum wage on December 31).  **Pending Updates:** Several jurisdictions adjust their minimum wage rates annually for inflation, some of which haven't yet announced whether and to what extent the minimum wage will increase for January 2023. This is not an exhaustive list. There may be additional jurisdictions that have scheduled increases for January 1. Check your state and local laws to confirm compliance.  **Multiple Rates** : If an employee is subject to more than one minimum wage requirement (such as federal, state, and local), you should generally comply with the rate most generous to the employee. Additionally, if your business is located in one state, but you have employees (such as remote workers) working in another jurisdiction, the minimum wage in the location where the employee performs work generally applies.  
What Is the Difference Between Full-Time (FT) and Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)?    What Is the Difference Between Full-Time (FT) and Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)?  Under the Affordable Care Act, a full-time employee is an employee who performs, on average, at least 30 hours of service per week or (130 or more hours per month).  A full-time equivalent (FTE) employee is calculated by:    1. Adding all the hours worked by part-time employees (those working less than 30 hours per week) in a month, for one month at a time.    2. Rounding up to 2 decimal points the total number of FTEs for each month.   3. Adding the Full Time employees to the FTEs to equal the total, for each month.   4. Adding each of the monthly totals together, then dividing by the number of months the client is active (ie. having more than 0 hours) for that year to arrive at the final FTE count.  Seasonal Employees  Under the ACA, an employer is not considered an Applicable Large Employer if they exceed 50 full-time (FT) and full-time equivalent (FTE) employees for 120 or fewer days during a calendar year and the employees in excess of 50 during that period were seasonal workers. Employees who have been marked with the Seasonal indicator on their Payroll Info page in the application are automatically excluded from the FT and FTE total calculation.  Example  If an employer had  20 Full-Time (FT) employees working more than or equal to 130 hours per month and 45 FTE employees who work more than or equal to 120 hours, but less than 130 hours per month the employer may be subject to the employer mandate provisions based on the following calculations.  **FT Employees = 20**  20 employees working more than 130 hours per month  **FTEs = 45**  45 employees working more than or equal to 120, but less than or equal to 130 hours per month  **20 Full-Time + 45 FTEs = 65**  
Full Service Direct Deposit (FSDD)    Full Service Direct Deposit (FSDD)  ****How Does Direct Deposit Work?****  ADP debits the total amount of all your employee's direct deposits for each payroll from your company's bank account. On payday, wages are deposited directly into your employee's designated bank account.  ****What Are the Benefits of Using Direct Deposit?****  By electronically depositing wages, your employees don't need to wait for paper checks to be delivered and deposits to clear. It also eliminates the risk of lost or stolen paper checks.  ****How Can I Tell if Direct Deposit Has Been Set Up for My Company?****  **Start here: Settings > Company > Bank accounts**  Make sure ****Yes**** is selected in the Activate Employee Direct Deposit field.  If direct deposit is not already set up and you would like it for your company, contact your ADP Service team.  
Garnishment    Garnishment  A garnishment is a court order that is issued to remit a portion of an employee's wages to the employee's creditor.

For RUN Powered by ADP® clients, payroll direct deposits may be subject to IAT requirements under either of the following conditions:    * **The company's payroll direct deposits ARE funded by a foreign bank** , even if the client is located in the United States and all direct deposit employees have U.S. bank accounts.    * **The company's payroll IS NOT funded by a foreign bank** , but an employee uses a domestic bank to consistently forward direct deposit funds to another country. In this circumstance, all of the client's direct deposit payments must be designated as IAT.

  S Corp FAQs     Q: My CPA told me I need to report my owner's insurance. What does that mean?  A: Normally, the owner's insurance is the amount that the business paid for the shareholder's health insurance.     Q: Is the shareholder's/owner's insurance paid out in a physical check?  A: No, the amount that is reported for the shareholder's/owner's insurance is only for recording the value of the fringe earning. The amount is reported, but is not paid to the employee.     Q: My CPA said that I should be paying the taxes on the shareholder's/owner's insurance right now. Do you know how I can avoid paying the taxes right now?  A: To avoid Federal Income Tax and/or State Income Tax from being withheld, the shareholder's/owner's insurance should NOT be reported as live wages. For example, if you're reporting the shareholder's/owner's insurance with your regular payroll, the insurance amount would need to be reported on a separate (2nd) check for the owner.     Q: How Do I Set Up an S Corp Earning?  A: You set up an S Corp earning the same way you set up other (fringe benefits) company earnings in ADP on the Earnings and Deductions Info page.  You can also see Getting started with S Corp.

  Federal Unemployment Tax  The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) imposes a payroll tax on employers, based on wages paid to employees. This tax, called FUTA tax, is used to help states fund unemployment compensation programs.  FUTA taxes are determined by applying a certain percentage to the taxable wages paid by the employer to the employee. FUTA taxes must be deposited quarterly. If the liability at the end of the quarter is $500.00 or less, the balance can be carried to the next quarter, but it must be paid by the fourth quarter due date.  Employers must report their FUTA tax liability annually on Form 940.  For more information on FUTA, contact your accountant or refer to the following websites:    * Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax on the IRS website (www.irs.gov)   * Instructions for Form 940 on the IRS website  Related info    * FUTA tax credit reduction  
  Voids FAQs     Can I void a check that includes a direct deposit?  Yes. When you void a check, RUN will void all payments included in that check.  You can request a refund during the voiding process. Refunds for direct deposits typically take 3-5 business days; however, we cannot refund direct deposits if the check date was more than five days ago, as per bank regulations.  Here's what we'll do if you request a refund for a direct deposit or ADPCheck payment:    * While we work on getting the money back, we'll refund the full amount of the payments to your account.     * To successfully refund a direct deposit, the employee must have the exact amount in their account. If an employee's deposits are split between more than one account, we'll refund all deposits.     * If for any reason we can't get the payment back, we'll debit your account for the amount we refunded.     * If you use ADPCheck, the employee will not be able to cash the check after the payment is revered. When you receive the check, please destroy it.     * To track the status of any refund requests, go to Home > Employee Refund Status.      Why don't I see a check I want to void?  There are a few reasons you may not see a check in your account:    * The check was already voided. After a check is voided, it's no longer displayed on the Void Checks page.    * The information you entered in the search fields on the Void Checks page doesn't match the details for the check you're trying to find.    * The payroll that included the check was never processed, so the check was never created.    * The check was cleared during a check reconciliation. After a check is cleared, it's no longer displayed on the Void Checks page. You must open the check again on the Check Reconciliation page before you can void it.      Why can't I void a check  Here are a couple common reasons why you may not be able to void a check:    * The check date is in a prior year    * The employee's quarter-to-date totals are insufficient   For additional help resolving the void error, please contact your ADP Service team.     Are the taxes also refunded when I void a check or payroll?  If your tax deposit was not already made, the money will be refunded within 7 to 10 business days. However, if your tax deposit was already made, you'll need to wait for the agency to refund the money.     Why can't I get a refund for a voided check?  Here are a few reasons why we aren't able to refund payments.    * The payment was made using a check from your company account. If the check hasn't been cashed yet, you can ask the bank to stop payment.   * The payment was made in cash.   * The check date of the direct deposit payment was more than 5 days ago. Per bank regulations, electronic payments can't be refunded after 5 business days.   * The check has already been cashed.  Please work with your employee to get the funds back.     Will I be charged for refunding a voided payment?  If you request the refund when you void the payment in the RUN Powered by ADPÂ® platform (RUN), you will not be charged. However::    * Standard payroll fees apply if you run an Off-Cycle payroll to include details for the voided payment in your tax filing.   * There may be additional charges for each refund if you contact your ADP Service team to refund the voided payment for you.     How will a void be reflected on my bank statement?  Depending on when the original payroll was processed, your bank may combine the voided and reissued payroll into one debit amount or you may see the original debit amounts followed by a debit/credit a few days later.  To confirm the final amounts that will reflect in your account, review each Payroll Liability report for the payroll. If using the same check date, the voided payroll will be labeled as "Payroll 2" and the reissued payroll as "Payroll 3".

  FUTA, SUTA, and FICA percentage of wages  FUTA, SUTA, and FICA are calculated based on the employee's total gross pay. The percentages of wages are as follows:    * FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) taxes:     * Social Security tax: The current Social Security tax rate is 6.2% for both employers and employees. It is applied to wages up to a set taxable wage limit, which is adjusted annually.     * Medicare tax: The current Medicare tax rate is 1.45% for both employers and employees. There is no taxable wage limit for Medicare tax.    * SUTA (State Unemployment Tax Act) taxes:     * The SUTA tax rate varies by state. Each state sets its own SUTA tax rate and taxable wage base. You can find the specific SUTA tax rate for your state by selecting Taxes > Federal, State, and local tax profile and then selecting the state from the list.    * FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax Act) taxes:     * The FUTA tax rate is 6% on an employee's first $7,000 earned each year. However, employers can receive a FUTA tax credit up to 5.4% from the IRS on the 940 Form for taxes already paid. This means that the effective FUTA tax rate is 0.6% for most employers.  The specific rates and limits may vary, so it's always a good idea to consult the IRS website or contact your state's unemployment agency for the most up- to-date information for your location.  
  Research an invoice debit or credit  If you have a question about a debit or credit that appears on your invoice, there are a fewreports that could help provide some additional information.  To begin, go to Reports > Popular Reports and select:    * Billing Invoices to view product-related transactions, additionaljurisdiction fees, Applied For status fees and Retirement Services invoices.     * Payroll Liability  to view any liabilities.   Common reasons invoices may have changed include:    * Multiple Payrolls: If you processed multiple payrolls within a short period of time, you may see them reflected on the same billing invoice. Review the left column on the invoice to view the check date the fee corresponds to. If more than one payroll and/or check dates are listed, you are being billed for multiple payrolls on that invoice.    * Price Increase: To continue delivering the highest quality products and services,ADPÂ® may periodically increase prices for products. If you have been processing at least six months, notifications of base payroll price increases will be included on a billing invoice at least 30 days in advance. We will send a $0 invoice if there is no billable activity during the notification period.    * State Fees: Your first state (SIT and SUI) and local tax filing jurisdictions are included in your payroll package. Each additional state jurisdiction results in an additional charge. Jurisdictions that are missing IDs (referred to as "Applied For" status) also incur an additional fee. These fees are charged per month for SIT and/or Local Jurisdictions, and per quarter for SUI jurisdictions, until the ID is updated in the system.    * Year-End Fees: Includes charges for W-2s, 1099s and other tax items. View more information here.    * Monthly Maintenance Billing (MMB) Fee: If you have not processed payroll in any 30-day period, you may be charged a MMB fee, which is equivalent to what you would be billed for a one-person payroll, plus any additional features.

  FUTA tax credit reduction     What Is a FUTA Tax Credit?  The FUTA tax rate for employers is 6% on an employee's first $7,000 earned each year. However, employers usually don't have to pay the full 6%. They can receive a FUTA tax credit up to 5.4% from the IRS on the 940 Form for taxes already paid, and only have to pay a FUTA tax rate of 0.6%.  FUTA Tax  |  FUTA Tax Credit  |  FUTA Tax Owed      ---|---|---      6%  |  5.4%  |  0.6%         Why Would a State Receive a Reduction in the FUTA Tax Credit?  If a state takes a loan from the federal government to pay unemployment benefits that can't be covered by state unemployment tax or insurance and doesn't repay the loan within two years, the FUTA tax credit is reduced and the state becomes a FUTA credit reduction state.  The first year the loan isn't repaid, the state receives a reduction of .3% in the FUTA tax credit. For each year that the loan isn't repaid, the tax credit reduces another .3%. After the loan is repaid, the state is eligible for the full tax credit.     How Is the FUTA Tax Credit Reduction Calculated?  Because 2023 is the second year that the loan is unpaid, the FUTA tax credit reduction is calculated by multiplying an employee's FUTA taxable wages (up to a maximum of $7,000) by .6%. This amounts to a total of $42.00 maximum owed per employee.     Which States Have FUTA Credit Reduction Requirements?  These states are subject to the FUTA Credit Reduction for 2023:    * California   * New York     Where Can I See My Additional FUTA Tax?  You can see the additional FUTA tax that you owe on your Form 940, Box 11.    1. Select the Taxes tab, and then select Tax Returns.   2. Select 2023, Q4, and then click Done.   3. Select 940 Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return.  Box 11 will display a calculation of additional FUTA taxes.  Related info    * Federal Unemployment Tax

  What type of organization do you have with the IRS?     Corporation (C corp)  A Corporation (C corp) is the most complex form of business. Although small businesses tend to be sole proprietorships or partnerships, it's not uncommon for a small business to incorporate. The owners of the business are shareholders of the corporation's capital stock and typically become the corporate officers.  Shareholders of a corporation are not personally liable for business liabilities, which makes this a good option for any business owner in any industry. An officer of a corporation is generally considered an employee, and as an employee, payments made for services rendered are considered wages and are subject to employment taxes. Unlike a sole proprietorship and partnership, the company should provide a W-2 to these employees.     S Corporation (S corp)  An S corporation (S corp) is a business that enjoys the benefits of incorporation without double taxation. The shareholders pay income tax on their earnings, but the corporation as a separate entity does not. What's more, shareholder distributions aren't subject to Medicare and Social Security taxes, also known as Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) taxes.     Not for profit  Not for profit corporations are formed for civic, educational, charitable, and religious purposes. Not for profit corporations have a tax-exempt status and limited personal liability. They don't have shareholders and corporate officers like a typical corporation. Instead, they are managed by a board of directors or trustees. In addition to limited liability, the not for profit company also enjoys a tax-exempt status. If a company is a non-profit group, they are typically exempt from employer-paid unemployment taxes.     Limited Liability Company (LLC)  Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a business structure allowed by state law that limits the members' personal liability for the debts and actions of the company - much like a corporation. LLCs are not available in all states.  The owners of an LLC are called members. Most states permit "single member" LLCs, those having only one owner. There is no maximum number of members an LLC can have.     Disregarded  A Disregarded entity is a Limited Liability company (LLC) with a single member owner, is not organized as a corporation, and is not taxed separately from the owner. Taxes owed by the business are paid on the owner's personal tax return.     Partnership  In a Partnership, there is a business relationship between two or more persons. This form of business is common for small businesses with more than one owner. Each partner contributes money, property, labor, or skill to the business and in return, receives a share of the profits and losses of the business based on their percentage of ownership. Each partner is personally responsible for a percentage of the income tax liabilities of the business, based on their percentage of ownership. Like a sole proprietorship, owners of a partnership are not considered employees of the company and therefore take draws from the business in anticipation of the current years' earnings.     Limited Partnerships (LPs)  Limited Partnerships (LPs) have complex formation requirements and require at least one general partner who is fully responsible for partnership obligations and normal business operations. The general partners report their share of profits and losses on their personal tax returns.  LPs also require at least one limited partner, often an investor, who is not involved in everyday operations and is shielded from liability for partnership obligations beyond the amount of their investment. The limited partner does not pay tax but must file a return for informational purposes.     Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs)  Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) are organized to protect individual partners from personal liability for the negligent acts of other partners or employees not under their direct control.  LLPs are not recognized by every state and those that do sometimes limit LLPs to organizations that provide a professional service, such as medicine or law, for which each partner is licensed.     Sole proprietor  A Sole Proprietorship is the simplest form of business and is a common choice for many small businesses. The liabilities of the business are considered the owner's personal liabilities. Taxes owed by the business are paid on the owner's personal tax return. This is the most common structure for solo entrepreneurs or "solopreneurs".

  Missing Social Security Number (SSN)  If your employees are missing their Social Security Number (SSN), ADP cannot report them as a new hire. You must manually report the employee as a new hire to the appropriate agency.  The RUN Powered by ADPÂ® platform (RUN) only accepts SSN or Employee Identification Number (EIN) for new hires. Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) are 9-digit numbers that start with 9 and are not proof of eligibility for employment in the U.S. Therefore, they are not accepted.  If the new hire provides proof of application for a Social Security Card, then the new hire can be added with a temporary SSN until you can obtain the valid number. Proof of application includes either:    * The Form SS-5 Application for Social Security Card   * Form I-765 Application for Employment Authorization, indicating the SSN has been requested  If you have either of the above forms, you can complete the following steps to add a temporary SSN.    1. In the SSN field, enter zeros (000-00-0000).    2. If you get an error, you may need to update your settings. Go to Settings > Company > Manager Employee Access > Employee Access Settings and toggle the Enable the Onboarding Process for New Hires? field to No.   3. Click Save.  **Important:** You must enter a valid SSN for this employee as soon as possible. If you do not submit a valid SSN by the end of the quarter, your State Unemployment Insurance (SUI) and 940 filings could be rejected; the SSN on the W-2 will display zeros, which requires an amendment and/or exception for all quarters that had zeros as an SSN; and the IRS may issue a $50 penalty.

  Add a company deduction  A deduction is a voluntary amount or percentage (other than taxes) subtracted from an employee or contractor's pay. The amount can be the result of a tax calculation, voluntary deduction, bank deposit, lien or benefit plan.  Company deductions are taken after taxes and garnishments are calculated and are usually associated with a benefit or service provided by the company. Deductions that have a statutory limit, like 401(k) or Social Security, stop automatically once the limit is reached.  A maximum of 30 company deductions can be active at one time.  For deduction descriptions and tax information, please view the Earnings and Deductions Quick Reference.  **Start here:**Settings > Payroll > Earnings and deductions    1.

If applicable, choose the marital status the employee selected on their state withholding certificate. If the employee didn't provide a certificate, select the Single option.

  Lost or uncashed checks     Lost check  If you or your employee lost a check, we recommend placing a stop payment as soon as possible for security purposes.    * If you utilize our ADPCheck feature, please contact yourADP Service team to request to void the check and reverse the funds back into your bank account. The funds will arrive within 3-5 business days. The check is no longer able to be cashed, so if it is located, it should be shredded immediately.   * If you do not use ADPCheck and checks are drawn from your company's bank account, you need to contact your bank directly and request a stop payment on the check. If your bank charges a fee for stop payments, it is the company's responsibility.  If funds still need to be issued to the employee, use one of these options:    * Write a company check for the net pay amount, if applicable. Taxes will not change, so no changes need to be made in the system.    * Include the net pay amount on the employee's next payroll as a Miscellaneous Non-Taxable Reimbursement. These amounts are not reported on the W-2, so it will only show the employee being paid one time.   * Run an off-cycle payroll to send a new check the next business day. The net pay should be entered as a Miscellaneous Non-Taxable Reimbursement.     Uncashed check  If you don't use our ADPCheck feature and your company checks are drawn from the company's account, you need to contact your bank directly to verify if a check has been cashed.  If you do use our ADPCheck feature, you can contact your ADP Service team to check the status of a check at any time.  ADPChecks that have not been presented for payment/cashed by 90 days (also known as stale-dated checks) are reported to ADP.    * After 90 days, the company is notified monthly until the check has been uncashed for 180 days.   * After 180 days, the net amount from the uncashed ADPCheck is automatically credited back to the company within 7-10 days.  
  Service charges for garnishments     State service charges  In some states, the court or agency that issued the garnishment can charge an administrative processing fee. Fee amounts and payment frequencies vary by state. The fee, where applicable, can be entered as a one-time payment or can be deducted with each employee garnishment deduction.  The state garnishment service charge is mandatory for child support orders. Currently, state service charges apply to child support garnishments only and must be indicated on the court support order.  The state service charges are handled in one of the following ways:    * If you enter the employee deduction amount for a child support garnishment as a flat amount and a service charge applies, you must add the service charge to the employee's garnishment deduction amount.   * If you enter the employee deduction amount for a child support garnishment as a percentage and a service charge applies, the service charge amount is added on after the garnishment percentage amount is calculated.     Employer service charges  Some states also allow employers to collect an administrative fee from their employees for processing garnishments. You must enter a corresponding voluntary employee deduction for the amount to be deducted. Enter any fee information in the Agency field on the employee's Garnishments page by going to People > Directory > [Select employee] > Garnishments.

  What is a tax recalculation?  Every time you run a payroll, the RUN Powered by ADPÂ® platform (RUN) ensures that the correct amount of the following taxes is being withheld:    * Social Security   * Medicare   * Federal Unemployment (FUTA)   * State Unemployment Insurance (SUI)   * State Disability Insurance (SDI)  If the correct amount of tax is not being withheld, a tax adjustment (also called a recalculation or recalc) will occur automatically.     What can cause a tax recalculation?  A tax recalculation occurs when a pending item or a payroll entry was submitted in the previous payroll that caused the employee's year-to-date tax withheld amount to be out-of-balance with the year-to-date taxable wage. Pending items include:    * Manual checks   * Voided checks   * Third party sick payments   * Prior payroll amounts (also called beginning balances)     How do I know if a tax recalculation has occurred?  If a recalculation has occurred, you'll see 2 entries for the same tax on your Payroll preview and Payroll details reports. The second entry has the word "Recalc" after it.  For example:  FED SOCSEC 7.60  FED SOCSEC - Recalc 1.78  The first entry is for the current payroll. The second entry is the recalculated tax amount (debit or credit) from the previous payroll.     What happens with the adjusted amount?  First, the employer is debited or credited for both the employee and employer portions of the tax recalculation.  Next, the employee is debited or credited for their portion of the tax recalculation the next time they are paid. This is how the company gets back the employee's portion of the recalculated amount.  If you need to refund a recalculation amount to an employee who is not being paid (for example, an employee on leave of absence), you can do one of the following:    * Issue a manual check for the amount.  **Important:** Do NOT enter the manual check details in RUN, because the recalculation is included in the employee's information automatically.    * Refund the amount in a regular or off-cycle payroll, using the Misc Reimbursement Non-taxable earning.

  Paid family and medical leave (PFML)  Typically, PFML operates as an insurance program that you and/or your employees pay into. Generally, PFML allows your employees who need to provide care-giving, or who need to take leave to take care of their own medical condition, to draw on the policy's benefits that provide a form of wage replacement while they're out on leave.     Paid Family Leave (PFL)  Some states allow employees to take paid family leave for certain protected reasons, such as:    * The birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care   * To bond with a child, within one year of the child's birth or placement   * To care for a family member with a qualifying serious health condition   * To manage family affairs when a family member is on active duty in the armed forces  To view the PFL ID, go to Taxes > Federal, state, and local tax profile and select the state from the left menu. Then, select Paid Family Leave.     Paid Medical Leave (PML)  Some states allow employees to take paid medical leave when they can't do their job because of a serious health condition.

  Is this employee exempt from state taxes?  Because of the tax implications, your company must be set up to allow employee tax exemptions. Please contact your ADP Service team if you need to select Yes for this field.  Select a check box ONLY if the employee has NO taxable income. Wages will not be reported for the tax on the employee's W-2.  If the employee has to pay income tax but does not want it taken from their paycheck, select No withholding in the Exempt from withholding field instead. An employee can be exempt from withholding or exempt from state income tax, but not both.  **Important:** It's rare for an employee to be exempt from taxes. Most employees have taxable income and are therefore NOT exempt. Selecting an exemption that doesn't apply will cause incorrect tax filings for both the employee and the company, and the employee may not receive a W-2.  The employee's exempt status will be used for any pending payrolls, manual checks, voided checks, paycheck calculations, and third party sick payments. If you entered tax amounts for a Pending items for this employee, you may want to change the exempt status after the pending item is processed.  
  Tip credits and make up tips  A tip credit is the amount employers do not have to pay in a particular pay period because that amount was earned in tips by an employee.  If the tips aren't enough to bring an employee's earnings up to the minimum wage rate, then an employer must pay employees enough to make up the difference. In the RUN Powered by ADPÂ® platform (RUN), this is called a make up tip. This amount is automatically printed on an employee's pay stub and payroll reports to remind employers to make up the unpaid wages.  RUN automatically calculates the make up tip using this formula: Make Up Tip = (Hours x Minimum Wage) - ((Hours x Rate Paid) + Total Tips Earned + Service Charge).  A Tip Credit report is available by going to Reports > Run single reports > Misc Reports > Tip Credit to help determine if you need to make up the difference.  An employee must be paid Tipped Hours to calculate the tip credit. If only regular hours are paid, the tip credit will not calculate.  
  What's the difference between a regular payroll and an off-cycle payroll?     Regular payrolls  Your regular payroll schedule is based on the pay frequency for your company, for example weekly or monthly. With a regular payroll, your check date is typically on the same day of the week or on the last day of the month.  When you run a regular payroll, any standard pay information (rates, hours) that you entered for your employees on the Pay Info page is pulled into the payroll worksheet automatically.     Off-cycle payrolls  An off-cycle payroll is not pre-scheduled. You can create and run an Off-cycle payroll whenever you need one.  You create and process off-cycle payrolls in almost the same way that you create and process regular payrolls, but there are a few important differences:    * You can change the dates for the pay period and check date.   * Voluntary deductions are not taken automatically. You choose which are taken.   * The payroll worksheet is not pre-populated with employee data such as regular hours, regular pay amounts, or timesheet data. However, rates are displayed for hourly employees.   * Paid time off does not accrue.

In What Order Are Multiple Garnishments Processed?    In What Order Are Multiple Garnishments Processed?  When an employee has more than one garnishment, the garnishment priority determines the order in which garnishments are deducted from the employee's pay. Sometimes, as is often the case with bankruptcies, all of an employee's garnishable wages might be allocated to the highest priority garnishment. In other cases, as with child support orders, the funds are prorated (distributed proportionally) or divided equally among the various garnishments, based on any limits applicable to deductions that can be made against an employee's net pay.  Because of statutory requirements, garnishments must be processed in the following order:    1. Mandatory support order (except when a Federal tax levy is in effect before the support order is established)   2. Bankruptcy   3. Federal administration garnishments (for example, federal business loan)   4. Federal tax levy (except deductions that were in place when the levy took effect)   5. Student loan   6. State tax levy   7. Local tax levy   8. Creditor garnishment   9. Employer deductions (for example, certain union dues, benefits)   10. Employee voluntary deductions (for example, charitable donations)  However, any of the following circumstances can impact the priority of a garnishment:    * Federal bankruptcies are processed before court-ordered support orders if the bankruptcy start date is earlier than the support order start date.    * Federal tax levies are processed before court-ordered support orders if the tax levy start date is earlier than the support order start date.    * Active bankruptcy, child support, or Federal tax levy liens take precedence over all state tax levies or garnishments.    * Individual states (such as Connecticut or Wisconsin) may have their own garnishment priority rules.   If an employee has two garnishments of the same type, the garnishment with the earliest issue date should be processed first.  If you have questions about the priority of a garnishment, contact the agency that issued the garnishment or consult your legal counsel.

  Tip reporting  To qualify as tipped employees, employees must work in an occupation in which they regularly receives $20 or more a month in tips. Employees who meet this requirement must keep track of all tips and report them to the employer.  There are two types of tipped employees:    * Directly tipped employees: An employee, such as a bartender, who receives cash or credit card tips directly from customers. Employees who receive both direct tips (from customers) and indirect tips (from a tip pool, for example), are considered directly tipped employees.   * Indirectly tipped employees: An employee who receives tips from tipped employees. For example, a busser may receive a portion of the tips directly received by the server. The busser is an indirectly tipped employee. Bartenders and service assistants are additional examples of indirectly tipped employees.  Employers must tax tips as part of each tipped employee's normal wages. The employer must also send the employee's reported tip totals to the IRS annually.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also requires employers to ensure that the total tips reported by all tipped employees equals at least 8% of the establishment's annual gross receipts. The difference between the amount of all reported tips and the percentage of the establishment's gross receipts is considered a company shortfall.  Tipped Establishments clients can use the Tip Allocation feature to calculate any tip shortfall for their companies. The Tip Allocation feature also allows clients to assign portions of the company shortfall amount to tipped employees who are underreporting their tips.     When Is tip reporting required?  The IRS requires that employees who receive $20 or more in tips per month must report all tips in writing to their employers.  Tips are considered part of an employee's wages and are subject to taxation. Tips are taxed for federal, FUTA, and Social Security and Medicare. Tips must be included in the employee's gross pay and deducted from the employee's net pay. Taxability for SUI, state, and local income taxes varies by state.

  State unemployment insurance (SUI) tax  State Unemployment Insurance (SUI), sometimes called an Experience Rate, is a tax taken from each paycheck, and filed quarterly. The tax is paid to a state unemployment agency, usually in the state where the employee works. The money goes into a fund that's used to pay unemployment insurance benefits to employees who are let go from their job.  Depending on the state, the SUI tax may be paid by the employer, the employee, or both. The rules for unemployment vary from state to state.  The amount of SUI tax owed each quarter is calculated using the rate that's assigned to you and your taxable wage limit established by the Department of Labor for your state. Each state has its own taxable wage limit. Use this chart to check each state's unemployement information.

It can be used to receive Direct Deposits as well as income from other sources.     How is Wisely Direct different than a pay card?  Wisely Direct is not a pay card program, which you may offer and administer to your employees as an alternate pay option.     Why would Wisely Direct be important to my employees?  A traditional bank account can be too costly or inconvenient for some employees. But, without one, cashing checks, paying bills and budgeting can be a challenge. For employees, Wisely Direct is a better pay experience, offers more financial control, and lets employees enjoy affordable financial services.     How much does Wisely Direct cost for cardholders?  For most items, like enrollment, direct deposit and minimum balance, there are no fees. Additionally, there are no overdraft fees, because we won't allow cardholders to overdraw their accounts. Some Wisely Direct services do carry a fee, which can be viewed here.     What are the benefits to me?  Wisely Direct can help improve your employees' financial well-being without giving you more work. There's no cost to you and nothing to implement or manage.

Does Wisely Direct cost me anything and do I need to administer it?  No, Wisely Direct is a prepaid account offered directly to consumers by ADP. It costs you nothing and doesn't require any employer administration.     Will I know if my employees have Wisely Direct?  Not necessarily.

There is no cost to get early Direct Deposit.     Is there anything special I need to do so my employees can get early Direct Deposit?  No, you don't need to do anything special. This does not change how you process your payroll. It also does not affect how or when you send payroll funds to the bank or payroll processor.Early Direct Deposit is only available to individuals with an activated Wisely Direct account.     How does early Direct Deposit work?  If my employee chooses to receive pay on a Wisely Direct (Card) and opts-in to receive early Direct Deposit, then:    1. I need to submit payroll to their bank.   2. Wisely Direct receives and processes the files from the employee's bank.   3. Wisely Direct deposits your employee's funds.  In most cases your employee will receive pay up to 2 days early (it may be less) based on the date that ADP receives payment instructions.     If an employee already has Direct Deposit set-up, do they need to opt-in to get paid early?  Yes, they need to opt-in to early Direct Deposit even if they already have Direct Deposit set up with a Wisely Direct account. It's simple and quick for your employees' to opt-in and enable early Direct Deposit. They can either:    * Login using MyWisely or   * Download the myWiselyÂ® app, go to Account Settings > Deposit Options, click to slide the Early Direct Deposit button to On and agree to the disclosures. This will enable early Direct Deposit.  Early Direct Deposit is available to individuals with an activated Wisely account on payments from qualified payers only and depends on when the deposit is received by Fifth Third Bank, N.A. Additional terms and conditions may apply. Once you set up Direct Deposit for your card, allow up to 3 weeks for funds to be loaded onto the card.  Standard text message fees and data rates may apply.

  1099 contractor overview  1099 contractors are paid to provide independent services. They do not receive company benefits. Taxes and garnishments, including child support, are not deducted from their payment. ADP provides 1099-NEC, 1099-MISC and 1096 forms for independent contractors.  The State printed on the 1099 form is the worked-in State if the worked-in State is a SIT taxing State. If not a SIT taxing state, then the lived-in State is printed.     Determination between contractor and employee  If the employer controls the result of the individual's work, but not what or how the work will be done, the worker is likely an independent contractor. However, you must correctly determine whether individuals are employees or independent contractors. IRS Common Law Rules determine a worker's employment designation by examining the level of control a worker has in these areas: Behavioral Control, Financial Control, and Relationship.  If, after reviewing these guidelines, it is still unclear, you or the worker can file Form SS-8 with the IRS for a determination.     Contractor setup  There are a few things to remember when setting up a contractor:    * A contractor's Work Location is the state where the work is being performed. If the contractor's Work Location is a state that is not currently set up, first add the appropriate jurisdiction as Exempt at the company level.   * An individual can work as an employee and an independent contractor at the same time, for the same company. To accommodate this, set up two profiles -- one as a W-2 employee using SSN and one as a 1099 contractor using SSN or TIN.   * RUN does not allow you to switch an employee from W-2 to 1099 contractor or vice versa. If you need to change an employee to a 1099 contractor (or vice versa), a separate profile must be set up in People. The original employee/contractor profile may need to be terminated in this scenario.     1099 contractor resources    * Understanding Employee vs. Contractor Designation \- IRS Fact Sheet   * Independent Contractor (Self-Employed) or Contractor? \- IRS Common Law Rules and Form SS-8   * Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide \- IRS Publication 15-A   * Form SS-8 and Instructions

On the Preview payroll page, select the employee's name to see their payment details.   2.

  Overtime pay  Employees who work more than 40 hours in a workweek are generally required by law to receive extra pay. Employees covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) earn at least one and a half times their regular rate of pay for the time they work in excess of 40 hours per workweek. Some occupations have different overtime rules.  Overtime for tipped employees is usually calculated by multiplying the regular rate of pay by 1.5 and then subtracting the tip credit. For example: Multiply Federal Minimum Wage of $7.25/hr by 1.5, which equals $10.88 Less Tip Credit of $5.12 Equals Overtime Rate $5.76.  For regular and tipped employees, you should review your local jurisdictional requirements, which can supersede federal law.     About the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes a minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping requirements, and child labor standards. The law affects full- time and part-time workers in the private and public sectors.  Covered, non-exempt employees must be paid for all hours worked in a workweek. They must also be paid overtime for all hours worked over 40 hours in the workweek. Compensable hours include all time an employee is on duty or at a prescribed place of work. This also includes:    * Work performed at home   * Travel time   * Waiting time   * Training   * Probationary periods  
  State tax IDs  If your state assesses income tax, your business must apply for a state tax identification (ID) number through the relevant state agency. If your local government also charges income tax, you need to apply for a local tax ID number, too.  Most states require businesses to have an identification number (ID), also known as an Employer Identification Number (EIN). Some states allow and accept businesses in Applied For status until the ID is obtained. However, ADP cannot deposit or file taxes on your behalf until you submit a valid EIN; it is your responsibility until ADP receives the EIN.  To mail tax-related information to ADP, please send it to: 400 W. Covina Blvd., San Dimas, CA 91773.

  Setting up an employee to comply with the Military Spouses Residency Relief Act  The Military Spouses Residency Relief Act applies to any person who is living in a state other than which they normally reside to be with their spouse who is there on military orders.  The service member's spouse will not lose residence or domicile in their state and does not become a resident of the state where the service member is serving. For taxation purposes, wages earned by the service member's spouse:    * Will not be considered income in the tax jurisdiction in which they are currently accompanying their service member spouse, and   * Is considered income in the state where they have residence, as long as the state is the same for the service member and spouse.  For example, suppose a couple lives in Oklahoma. Spouse A (who is in the military) has military orders to be stationed in Ohio for one year. Spouse B moves with Spouse A to Ohio. Spouse B should not be taxed for Ohio state income tax or any "resident" locals that may apply. Instead, Spouse B should be taxed for Oklahoma state income tax.  Before you can add the military spouse employee to your account, their home state jurisdiction must be added on a company level first. Then, you can:    1. Add the new hire as you normally would.   2. Select the state income tax of the state of residence (the employee's home state).   3. Select the state unemployment tax of the state where they work.

  Garnishment priorities  When an employee has more than one garnishment, the garnishment priority determines the order garnishments are deducted from the employee's pay. Sometimes, all of an employee's garnishable wages will be allocated to the highest priority garnishment. In other cases, the funds are prorated or divided equally among the garnishments, based on deduction limits that can be made against an employee's net pay.  Garnishments must be processed in the following order due to statutory requirements:    1. Mandatory support order - except when a Federal tax levy is in effect before the support order is established   2. Bankruptcy   3. Federal administration garnishments (i.e., a federal business loan)   4. Federal tax levy - except deductions that were in place when the levy took place   5. Student loan   6. State tax levy   7. Local tax levy   8. Creditor garnishment   9. Employer deductions (i.e., union dues or benefits)   10. Employee voluntary deductions (i.e., charitable donations)  If an employee has two of the same garnishment types, the one with the earliest issue date should be processed first.  The following circumstances can also impact priority:    * Federal bankruptcies are processed before court-ordered support orders if the bankruptcy date is earlier than the support order start date.    * Federal tax levies are processed before court-ordered support orders if the tax levy start date is earlier than the support order start date.   * Active bankruptcy, child support, or Federal tax levy liens take precedence over all state tax levies or garnishments.   * Individual states (such as Connecticut or Wisconsin) may have their own garnishment priority rules.  Please contact the agency that issued the garnishment or consult your legal counsel if you have any questions.  
  Voluntary Plan Disability Insurance  Some states provide an option that allows companies to purchase private disability insurance in place of State disability insurance (SDI). These plans are referred to as Voluntary Plan Disability Insurance (VPDI) plans. The company or an insurance carrier administers this insurance. Premiums are deducted from the employee's pay and the money is sent to an insurance carrier or held by the employer and applied to a state approved self-insured plan.  Hawaii and New York require that all employers use Voluntary Plan Disability Insurance (VPDI). The benefits must be equal or greater than what's provided by State Disability Insurance (SDI).  VPDI benefits are subject to Social Security and withholding taxes.

  What do I do if an employee is exempt from a federal tax?  **Important:** It's rare for an employee to be exempt from taxes. Selecting an exemption that doesn't apply will cause incorrect tax filings for both the employee and the company, and the employee may not receive a W-2.  **Before you begin:** Because of the tax implications, your company must be set up to allow tax exemptions. Please contact your ADP Service team if you need to set up an employee as exempt from taxes.

  Requesting ADP's W-9 form  If you need ADP's Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and certification information as your payroll provider, you may request a copy from an ADP Representative. Form W-9 is not filed with the IRS, but the information included on this form can be used to file Forms 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC.

Bonuses with large tax or money movement liability have certain requirements:  Amount  |  Agency Requirements  |  ADP Requirements      ---|---|---      Over $100K  |  Tax liability must be deposited to the agency by the business day after the check date.  |  Payrolls processed less than two days before the check date may require a wire transfer to ensure timely deposits.      Over $400K  |  A wire transfer is required.      You can either include the bonus in a regular check, a separate check or run an Off-Cycle Bonus Payroll.

  Fringe benefits  A fringe benefit is a form of compensation for the performance of services. For example, you provide an employee with a fringe benefit when you allow them to use a business vehicle to commute to and from work.

Any fringe benefit your company provides is taxable and must be included in the employee's pay unless the law specifically excludes it. The benefit is subject to employment taxes and must be reported on the employee's W-2.  Review the Earnings and Deductions Quick Reference to see a complete list of earnings and deductions available in the RUN Powered by ADPÂ® platform (RUN). For more information about fringe benefits, contact your accountant or view Publication 15-B, Employer's Tax Guide to Fringe Benefits on the IRS website.

  Troubleshoot tax not taken out     Employee taxes not withheld  With the changes made to income tax withholding in 2020, one of the most common reasons taxes are not withheld on the payroll is an employee may not have made enough in the pay period to have those taxes withheld. You can use the Calculate Checks tool to confirm this by increasing the employee's number of hours (or salary amount) to see if taxes are then calculated.      Review the Payroll Details report  **Start here:**Reports > Run Single Reports > Payroll Reports > Payroll Details    1. Filter the report by check date and employee.   2. Review the earnings and deductions on the employee's pay.   3. Review the last time the tax was taken, if applicable.   4. Review the Employee Change Report to see if any changes were made (Reports > Run Single Reports > Payroll Reports > Employee Change).      Review the Employee Profile    1. Check the employee's taxes and jurisdictions setup.   2. Check for exemptions and allowances.   3. Check for setup of locals.      Use the Calculate Checks feature  **Start here:**Payroll > Calculate manual checks    1. Select the employee and enter the check date and period covering.   2. Increase gross pay until you see tax withheld.   3. Remove any allowances the employee may have in their profile and calculate to see if any federal tax will be deducted.       Review Earnings and Deductions Taxability  **Start here:**Settings > Payroll > Earnings and deductions    1. Click Edit by the earning/deduction the employee was paid to confirm the taxability.

  Which earning should I use for tipped employee meals?  Meals provided to tipped employees are considered part of the employee's wages.  There are two earnings available for tipped employee meals:    * Meals (Taxable): Meals provided primarily for the benefit of the employee, who accepts them voluntarily. For example, a waiter who works an 8-hour shift in a diner may choose to eat a meal after the shift ends.   These meals must be offered to the employee at the employer's cost, and are subject to all payroll taxes. Enter these meal costs in the Meals (Taxable) column in the payroll worksheet.    * Meals (Employer Convenience): Meals provided by the employer at the work site, which employees are expected to eat on the premises. For example, a diner provides a meal to all employees working the evening shift to ensure that employees are not late returning from breaks.  These meals are not taxable, except for SUI in some states. In the payroll worksheet, enter these meal costs in the Meals (Employer Convenience) column.

  Change the tax designation (pre-tax or post-tax) for a deduction  Contact your ADP representative if you need to change the tax designation (from pre-tax to post-tax, or vice versa) for a deduction.  Please be advised of the following:    * If contributions were pre-tax and are changed to post-tax, the employee may owe taxes when they do their personal return.   * If contributions were post-tax and are changed to pre-tax, this would normally lower taxability and the federal tax would be given as a refund to the employee at that time.    * ADP recommends that you do not void and reissue. If a void and reissue is done later in the year, taxes would have already been deposited and the employee would have already been paid. This could lead to potential debits that will hit the business directly, since the employee already had these wages paid out.

  Avoid Reprinting W-2s and 1099s at year-end  Certain changes may require updated W-2s and 1099s that can cost you money. There are typically two changes that may result in having to re-print W-2s and 1099s. Click the arrow to display additional information.     Updating employee or contractor info  Scenario: Your last payroll of the year is done and we already processed your W-2s and 1099s. You realize you need to update any of the following information for an employee or contractor.    * Name   * Address   * Social Security Number   * Company paid pension   * Statutory employee   * Company Name (1099)   * TIN (1099)  Be sure to update all information for your employees and contractors before we process your W-2s and 1099s.  If you do have to update this information after we process your W-2 and 1099s, we'll let you know the potential charges--and we'll give you the option to save the changes without updating the W-2 or 1099. For more information, see Change or correct a 1099 or Correct a W-2 or a filing from a prior quarter     Running a payroll after W-2s and 1099s have already been sent  Scenario: Your last payroll of the year is done and we already sent your W-2s and 1099s. You start to run a payroll that includes any date in the prior year.  When you preview the payroll, we'll show you the potential charges--and we'll give you the option to change the check date to avoid the charges.  **Important:** If an employee receives payment in the next year for days worked in the current year, earnings and deductions are reflected in the new year. Payroll taxes are based upon the date wages are paid (the check date), not the date wages are earned.  The last day you can submit your final payroll is December 31 (If 12/31 falls on a weekend, your payroll must be submitted on the last Friday of December). Payrolls submitted after this date may incur penalties and interest charges. Ensuring that the employee and contractor information is accurate will help you avoid fees.

Social Security and Medicare Taxes    Social Security and Medicare Taxes  The Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) requires that employers and employees contribute to employee retirement, medical, and disability insurance. Social Security and Medicare taxes are the two components of FICA.  Social Security taxes fund the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) requirement of FICA. Social Security tax is withheld from an employee's wages up to a set taxable wage limit which is adjusted annually. A matching contribution is required from the employer.  Medicare taxes fund the Hospital Insurance (HI) requirement of FICA. It benefits individuals age 65 and older and some disabled persons. Medicare tax is withheld from an employee's wages. There is no taxable wage limit for Medicare. A matching contribution is required from the employer.  For current Social Security and Medicare rates, refer to the IRS website (www.irs.gov).

  Alabama overtime earning  Alabama House Bill 217 states that overtime pay received by a full-time, hourly wage-paid employee for working more than 40 hours in a workweek is excluded from gross income and therefore exempt from Alabama state income tax (SIT). This goes into effect for overtime wages paid beginning January 1, 2024, and is scheduled to end on June 30, 2025.  The earnings below are available to use when keying in payrolls:    * Alabama Overtime (AL OVT): Should be used to report amounts that will not be subject to Alabama SIT.   * Alabama Tipped Overtime (AL TIP OT): For employers with tipped employees only. Should be used to report tipped overtime that is not subject to Alabama SIT.   Begin using the new Alabama Overtime earning or Alabama Tipped Overtime earning (for employers with tipped employees only) with your first payroll of 2024.  Items exempt from SIT include:    * Overtime earned for working more than 40 hours in a workweek   * Shift premiums or differentials paid on eligible overtime wages    * Overtime paid on bonuses and similar payments (if the overtime was earned for working more than 40 hours in a workweek)  The following wages are not excluded from Alabama SIT and do not count toward the 40-hour weekly threshold:    * Wages paid for hours not worked, such as paid sick leave, paid time off and jury duty leave. For example, if an employee is paid for 8 vacation hours and works 32 regular hours and 12 overtime hours, the wages associated with only 4 of the overtime hours will be exempt from Alabama SIT because the 8 vacation hours do not count toward the 40-hour weekly threshold. In this scenario, the wages exempt from Alabama SIT will need to be paid using the Alabama Overtime earning.   * Wages paid for hours not subject to Alabama SIT withholding. In general, these would be hours worked outside Alabama in a state that also has SIT. For example, if an employee works 8 regular hours in Georgia, 32 regular hours in Alabama and 12 overtime hours in Alabama in a given workweek, only the wages associated with 4 of the overtime hours will be exempt from Alabama SIT, because the 8 hours worked in Georgia do not count toward the 40-hour weekly threshold. In this scenario, the wages exempt from Alabama SIT will need to be paid using the Alabama Overtime earning.   * Wages paid to Alabama residents working in a state that does not have state income tax (such as Florida, Tennessee) are subject to Alabama SIT for hours worked in those states. Hours worked by those hourly employees are counted toward the 40-hour weekly threshold and overtime earned for working more than 40 hours in a week would be exempt from Alabama SIT. The same would apply to hours worked by Alabama residents in a jurisdiction where the configuration would result in the employee being subject to Alabama SIT.   * Wages paid to salaried nonexempt employees. The exclusion from Alabama SIT applies only to overtime paid to hourly-paid employees.  For more information, refer to the Agency FAQs.

Why Would I Run a Payroll With Timecards?    Why Would I Run a Payroll With Timecards?  This topic only applies if the ADP Time & Attendance feature is activated. If you track time for non-salaried employees using ADP Time & Attendance, you should process your employees' payrolls with timecard info. Using timecards, makes processing your payroll easier by:    * Recording all payroll info and moving it to one central file   * Removing transcription errors and delays   * Reducing the workload for you payroll staff who would have had to manually calculate employee's hours   * Eliminating the hassle of dealing with employee complaints, because of payroll errors due to manual transcription  
Why Would I Use a Payment Check?    Why Would I Use a Payment Check?  **Start here: Settings > Payroll > Company payment checks**  **If many of your employees make payments to a single agency**  You can create a company payment check to combine their individual deductions into a single check for each pay period in which the deduction is active.  For example, you offer your employees a 401(k) program run by a third-party provider. Creating a company payment check allows you to include the 401(k) deductions for all your employees in a single check for each payroll. A check payable to the third-party provider is automatically created and can be sent directly to the provider, if the Garnishment Payment Service (GPS) feature is set up. (See GPS Garnishment and Non-GPS Garnishment sections below.)  **If an individual employee must make a payment to an individual agency**  You can create an employee payment check for each pay period in which the deduction is active.  For example, individual employees may have court-ordered child support garnishments attached to their wages. You can create employee payment checks for individual employees. A check, payable to the child support agency, is created automatically for the amount of the garnishment withheld from the employee. The payment check is delivered with the payroll package and the employer is responsible for forwarding the payment to the garnishing agency. (See GPS Garnishment and Non-GPS Garnishment sections below.)  **GPS Garnishment**  The GPS feature is a payment option for garnishments. When GPS is active for one or more of your employees, the garnishment deduction amount will be withheld from the employee's pay and the garnishment funds are transferred to the payee for you. The payments are processed through ADP by ACH or check, based on the schedule that is set up in RUN.  **Non-GPS Garnishment**  When the GPS feature is not activate for one or more of your employees, it's a non-GPS garnishment. The garnishment deduction can be set up within the payroll application. The garnishment deduction amount will be withheld from the employee's pay and you are responsible for ensuring that the payment is made to the garnishing agency. ADP is not responsible for remitting the payment. You can use one of the following options to remit payment to the agency:    * **Manual Check** : Write and send a manual check to the garnishing agency.   *  **Payment Check** : Set up a payment check to generate automatically when the employee is paid. The payment check is delivered with your payroll package and you are responsible for forwarding the check to the garnishing agency.   **Important** : You can't have both GPS garnishments and non-GPS garnishments. If the GPS feature is activate, ADP sends all garnishment payments.  
Why Would I Lock My Employees' Timecards?    Why Would I Lock My Employees' Timecards?  This topic only applies if the ADP Time & Attendance feature is activated. You would lock your employees' or practitioners' timecards for the chosen pay period if you:    * Don't want any more changes to be made while you confirm that the information is correct   * Find errors that need to be corrected   * Are getting ready to run payroll   **Tip** : Your timecard may be locked if you have exceptions to resolve. To unlock the timecard, you need to review and correct the exceptions.

  Paid Time Off (PTO)  Paid Time Off (PTO) is an employer-offered policy that allows employees to receive payment for time taken off from work. Common types of PTO include Sick, Vacation and Personal. While you can rename a PTO earning on the Earnings Deductions page on the payroll worksheet, the original PTO name (Vacation, Sick, Personal) will be displayed on PTO tracking, reports and paystubs.  On a federal level, there are no legal requirements for a minimum amount of PTO. However, some jurisdictions have PTO-specific labor law regulations, and many require Sick time off be paid and balances to be displayed on an employee's wage statement.  Related info    * Set up a paid time off (PTO) plan at the company level    * Set up PTO for an employee    * Edit an employee's PTO balances    * Check an employee's PTO balance when processing payroll    * Correct PTO on a payroll    * Pay out acrrued PTO    * Carry over acrrued PTO    * Clear PTO accrual balances for year-end    * Can an employee have negative PTO hours?

  Can I stop all deductions for a regular payroll?  No, because regular payrolls include deductions that are scheduled to be taken from the employee's pay on a regular basis. For a regular payroll, you should not stop all the deductions scheduled for an employee.  If you need to stop all deductions for a payroll, run an off-cycle payroll and clear all the checkboxes in the Select deductions area on the Set up payroll page.  
  Why would I set up departments for a company?

Select Tax notices and IRS letters.   2. Drag and drop the file you want to upload, or select Upload file and find it on your computer. Then select Next.   3. Select what you want us to do for you.     * Research the notice \- I want ADP to review and research the tax notice.     * Pay amount due \- I authorize ADP to debit the total amount due from my bank account. I understand no further research will be done by ADP.   4. Complete the fields using the info from the notice.  For an IRS notice, you can usually find this information in the upper-right corner of the document. For a state notice, you can find it in the upper or lower-left section of the document.    5. Select Submit. If you selected Pay amount due, you'll be asked to confirm the amount that will be debited from your account.  Keep in mind that some notices can take a bit of time to review and resolve, especially complex notices. Once ADP has completed the review of the notice, an email will be sent to the owner on the account as confirmation.  While we're working on a notice, you may receive additional notices for the same issue. If you do, please upload them as well.  Remember to keep a copy of the notice for your records.  
  Where can I find unemployment insurance (UI) information for each employee?  Quarterly unemployment insurance information for your employess is available in the Wage and Tax Register report. To view this report, go to Reports > Single reports > Taxes reports > Wage and Tax Register.  For Nebraska companies, RUN provides the UI-11T Combined Tax Report.

  Year-end fees and other charges  The following table lists charges that will be incurred for the processing of W-2s, 1099s, and other tax items.  Process  |  Fees      ---|---      W-2s and 1099s  |  $54.95 base charge + $6.50 per form  (+ $32.50 base charge for additional controls / related companies)      W-2 UPS delivery  |  $13.95 base charge  There is only one base charge, not two charges for W-2s and 1099-MISCs/NECs.      Year-End reprints/reprocessing  |  $54.95 (base charge) + $6.50 per W-2 reprint + cost of adjustment payroll (if needed) + $13.95 (delivery cost)  Tips to avoid reprints:  After your W-2s and 1099s have been created and sent to you, your employees can view and print their own W-2s and 1099s using Employee Access.  If you don't have Employee Access, you can go to Reports > W-2s and 1099s to re-print your tax statements. The content in the report is identical to the individual W-2s, W-3s, 1099s, and 1096s.      Amendments  |  $150 flat fee to correct any previously filed returns or W2s.  Amendments are adjustments to already filed returns.      Late Original  |  $150 flat fee for any returns filed after the original due date.  Late originals are returns that have not been filed to state or local agencies.      *Fees are effective as of December 2022 and may vary based on applicable terms and conditions of service.  
  Monthly maintenance billing fees  If you have not processed payroll in one or more recent pay periods or have temporarily closed your business, you may be charged a monthly maintenance billing (MMB) fee.  The issuance of a MMB fee may vary depending on your company's pay frequency and is equivalent to what you would be billed for processing payroll that includes one employee check, plus any additional features.  This fee allows ADP to:    * Keep your account active, giving you the flexibility to process payroll on an "as-needed" basis   * File quarterly and annual tax returns as required even if there are no payrolls processed  Seasonal businesses, annual processors and new accounts (within 90 days of the start date with ADP) are not subject to MMB fees. Other exceptions may apply.

You may keep this form for your records, however, you will need to file your own taxes using a 1040 Schedule H.   * You may be required to make the estimates or you may pay the entire amount when filing your 1040 Schedule H. Please consult your tax professional to make this determination.

  Enter prior pay period overtime information for an employee  This topic applies only to California clients with at least one active employee working or living in the state.  If an employee has overtime hours and/or double time from a prior pay period, then you must include the pay period start and end dates for these hours in the payroll worksheet. Entering these dates allows you to separate current overtime and/or double time hours from overtime and/or double time hours from a prior pay period.    1. In the payroll worksheet, highlight the employee who has overtime and/or double time hours.   2. Click Add row.   3. Enter overtime and/or double time hours for the employee in the new row. The Pay Period Start Date and Pay Period End Date columns are displayed automatically on the right side of the worksheet.  **Important:** While the Pay period start date and Pay period end date fields display on all rows for all employees in the worksheet, you can only make entries in the fields that apply to an employee with overtime and/or double time in an added row. California requires employers to provide period start and end dates for earnings paid for work done in prior pay periods, such as: Adjustments, Retro Pay, Quarterly/Annual Bonuses, Monthly Commission (or any period other than the current period). These dates can be added manually to display on the employee's check stub.    4. In the Pay period start date and Pay period end date columns, enter the pay period dates to which the overtime and/or double time applies.  You can enter overtime and/or double time for additional prior pay periods by clicking Add Row again and repeating this step.    5. Click Save.  The prior period dates will print in the Description section of the Earnings area of the employee's check stub. If you entered overtime and/or double time for multiple prior pay periods for an employee, the amounts will be sorted and displayed in date order.  Another option to pay employee earnings for work done in prior pay periods is to process an Off-Cycle payroll. This allows you to pay any earnings for a prior pay period and include the correct prior period start and end dates. For more information, see Run an off-cycle payroll.
