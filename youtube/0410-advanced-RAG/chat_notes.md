â€‹â€‹Hello, people yougotthis!

InsiteGD
â€‹â€‹which are the best RAG techniques when we have an app that will receive documents along the time and will update the information, for example: we are going to receive documents about machines. Thanks

Krishna Prasad
â€‹â€‹super excited, I implemented various chunking strategies now to explore diff retrieval methods. I know langchain has a few good ones like multi-vector

Charles Kilpatrick
â€‹â€‹I can see screen fine

â€‹â€‹Does chunking work for tables in documents?

â€‹â€‹LlamaParse can help you extract tables from documents. I would imagine you parse first and then chunk.

Dino Vitale
â€‹â€‹I think an under-estimated effort ifs understanding the type of questions need to service -- some questions many benefit from different chunking than some that may be more complex (hierarchical)

â€‹â€‹My fav part, when The Wiz gets on Collab !

AI Makerspace
â€‹â€‹Haha I love this part too! @Aman

Vignesh Iyer
â€‹â€‹["Review_Date", "Review_Title", "Review_Url", "Author", "Rating"] was review title part of the orginal data

Vignesh Iyer
â€‹â€‹Great thanks for confirming!

Arthi Kasturirangan
â€‹â€‹Is RAG only for Q&A, or can it be used effectively for summarization.

Arthi Kasturirangan
â€‹â€‹thanks

barthotronic
â€‹â€‹I assume that in production you'd want to store parent docs in something other than memory - on-disk vectorstore?

Arthi Kasturirangan
â€‹â€‹Sql store will be useful

Skitsanos
â€‹â€‹Okay, where is the Haystack and Semantic Kernel??

Vignesh Iyer
â€‹â€‹Could you please explain how self-query works - how the question turns into a query with meta-data - does the LLM decide how to do this - was it fine -tuned to do this?

â€‹â€‹@vigneshWe are leveraging an LLM to help us do the filtering - yes!

â€‹â€‹Amazing @AI Makerspace! Thank you for your generocity to keep teaching us the insides of LLMs!

Vignesh Iyer
â€‹â€‹Thanks @Chris Alexiuk !

InsiteGD
â€‹â€‹could you share de Google colab, please?

Chris Alexiuk
â€‹â€‹It's a bit like Text2SQL in that sense, but it's using the VectorDBs metadata as the Structured Query.

Chris Alexiuk
â€‹â€‹**for the Structured QUery

Arthi Kasturirangan
â€‹â€‹@Chris Alexiuk . will you be sharing the notebook for our reference? it will be helpful pls.

â€‹â€‹thank you

Parth Makode
â€‹â€‹what are best ways to index tables ,

Paolo V.
â€‹â€‹Thanks Wiz and Dr. Greg

InsiteGD
â€‹â€‹the technique will be to make a summary of a table, isn it?

Dhananjay Kumar
â€‹â€‹the conventional chunking with numerical data is still a challenge

Srinivas Raman
â€‹â€‹could you pls share the assessment nb to assess these methods as well that Chris mentioned.

barthotronic
â€‹â€‹Where does the RAPTOR approach fit into your enhanced RAG schema?

Aman Bansil - Crush The Wealth Gap
â€‹â€‹Is there any way to send you guys a question over email? or somewhere I can type more detail? needed guidance on something.

InsiteGD
â€‹â€‹thank you
